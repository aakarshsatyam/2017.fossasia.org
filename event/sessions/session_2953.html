                <p>The KDE community has always strongly believed in openness, in free and open source software. Today, we’re taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not doing it alone, but with the help of institutions and professors all around the globe.</p><p>What is WikiToLearn? WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!” </p><p>Why is it an innovation?WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone. </p><p>         Why should I contribute?It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be able to continue to grow. Your contribution, as small as it could be, is and will always be fundamental.Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. However, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone decided to contribute to creating it.</p><p>Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire to see, at last, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because so you can really feel useful and part of something great, with the power change the world.</p><p>Who can contribute? </p><ul><li>I’m a university student, I don't have time for this...Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams, as well as to improve your explanation skills. Moreover, this is often the best way to realise what you did not understand, and in case you make a mistake, someone will correct you.</li><li>But I'm a professor!- WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the teachers.Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</li><li>I’m a coder! - Do you want to help WikiToLearn "under the hood"? This is the right page for you to get started! First of all, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can also count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribute immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki, so we always need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you’re interested in contributing to open source software, WikiToLearn can be a great place.</li><li>I’m a translator! - Are you fluent in (at least) two languages? WikiToLearn needs you!Translating on WikiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills, at the same time you will learn about new things, and you will contribute to the growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written from scratch, the translation into several languages is as important as the content itself, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.</li></ul><p>Who "makes" WikiToLearn? - The project is promoted and coordinated by a community of people, often experts in their own field, who write, review and organise the content. WikiToLearn is a KDE project sponsored by Wikimedia.</p>

Today, we’re taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not doing it alone, but with the help of institutions and professors all around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is WikiToLearn? WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it an innovation?WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;         Why should I contribute?It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be able to continue to grow. Your contribution, as small as it could be, is and will always be fundamental.Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. However, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone decided to contribute to creating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire to see, at last, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because so you can really feel useful and part of something great, with the power change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who can contribute? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a university student, I don&#x27;t have time for this...Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams, as well as to improve your explanation skills. Moreover, this is often the best way to realise what you did not understand, and in case you make a mistake, someone will correct you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But I&#x27;m a professor!- WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the teachers.Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a coder! - Do you want to help WikiToLearn &quot;under the hood&quot;? This is the right page for you to get started! First of all, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can also count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribute immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki, so we always need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you’re interested in contributing to open source software, WikiToLearn can be a great place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m a translator! - Are you fluent in (at least) two languages? WikiToLearn needs you!Translating on WikiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills, at the same time you will learn about new things, and you will contribute to the growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written from scratch, the translation into several languages is as important as the content itself, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who &quot;makes&quot; WikiToLearn? - The project is promoted and coordinated by a community of people, often experts in their own field, who write, review and organise the content. WikiToLearn is a KDE project sponsored by Wikimedia.&lt;/p&gt;');
