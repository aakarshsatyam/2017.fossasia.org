This gives rise to the need for heterogeneous computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style=\"\">These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar co-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span style=\"\">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily available off the shelf, some of them as commercially available system on chips (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software programmer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware accelerators within a system on chip are many, such as high-performance gains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the exotic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it. </span><span style=\"\">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write accelerators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abstraction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively difficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a few years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the name suggests. However off late, with computing problems of large sizes and datasets, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style=\"\">Even with a great number of devices available, the difference in programming models makes it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=\"\">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware acceleration, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use these devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration. In order to achieve the full potential of hardware acceleration, multiple heterogeneous devices within the same SoC must be programmable using a single programming model and also the programming model must be portable across devices without loss of functionality. The aim of this talk is to throw light on the OpenCL(Open Computing Language API) and its potential for being the one single language that can be used to program multiple devices.</span></p>","video-url":null,"id":"2958","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":3,"name":"Fermi (Floor 3)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"197"},"track":{"name":"Hardware & Making","color":"#c45b1f","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","id":"218"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/prashantrar","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2305/photo/dCtmb1VFZT/5d3b4bd2-d598-4173-9f81-3d5352990b71.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Singapore","position":"Software Engineer","name":"Prashant Ravi","speaking-experience":null,"email":"prashantrar@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/prashantrar","gender":"Male","country":"India","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"Nanyang Technological University","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2305/small/ek53QkZrL0/425c1138-8529-42cf-835f-d6d8bb88997b.jpg","github":"https://github.com/prashantrar","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2305/icon/OHlOdzV4T3/210c0173-4099-49a8-8d9c-45d3b8ebd43f.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Masters Student, Software Engineer with specialization in embedded systems.

The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface from C++, Python, Octave, R, Java, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc. This not just means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++ and target languages. One of the focus point of the talk is the introduction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a user can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' syntax, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported languages of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the number of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the method being exposed to all of the target languages, but it allows us to have those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics, the toolbox saw massive extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many classical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric, multi-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature hashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few. Shogun in addition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel hypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc. All algorithms are supported by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning, preprocessing, serialisation &amp; I/O, etc; the resulting combinatorial possibilities are huge.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/gD_l_VnNL7U","id":"2843","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":1,"name":"Mendel (Ground Floor)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"166"},"track":{"name":"AI & Machine Learning","color":"#4da898","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"266"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/viktor-gal-3483935","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2201/photo/d2VoNjIwQ1/1485799570.06.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Singapore","position":"Data scientist","name":"Viktor Gal","speaking-experience":null,"email":"viktor.gal@maeth.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":null,"gender":"Male","country":"Hungary","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox ","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2201/small/UnlKUFk1aW/dcca1cb1-09ec-4587-8a64-5699937ed277.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2201/icon/Y1FvU1RFUT/bff7c689-49ca-4fee-b4c1-6304298e90f5.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Viktor Gal is currently working as a data scientist.

I was the lead Android developer of the team. I will be talking about how we worked with the government and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development, scalability, security, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dynamic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different government and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included automated source code testing, white boxtesting, blackbox testing and manual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app, we did multiple load tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers. Finally I will talk about the release process of the app and the ongoing maintenance.Contest Details - <a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details</a> about the release - <a href=\"https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1</a></p>","video-url":null,"id":"2834","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":3,"name":"Planck (Floor 3)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"198"},"track":{"name":"Android","color":"#b852d1","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","id":"274"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/naman14","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2192/photo/QUlHWkxlZG/693beeae-0263-409d-807e-bb01bc41e63e.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"New Delhi","position":"Student","name":"Naman Dwivedi","speaking-experience":null,"email":"namandwivedi14@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/naman1405","gender":"Male","country":"India","website":"http://naman-dwivedi.in","is-featured":null,"organisation":"Delhi Technological University","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2192/small/VzB2OUtLb3/fa842a94-a759-4b69-8958-c408b6a52b0a.jpg","github":"https://github.com/naman14","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2192/icon/UkpFL1ZIR3/666f5415-b80d-4231-85c0-7c9244d1c195.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I am a 3rd year Engineering student from India and an open source enthusiast.

It can be seen as an extension of NLTK, but with special consideration for the unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). We plan to extend to other languages, as well.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading environment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates reading, note taking, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package. </span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>","video-url":null,"id":"2891","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":1,"name":"Scientist for a Day (Ground Floor, Hall A)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"169"},"track":{"name":"Design, Art, Community","color":"#9c7171","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","id":"222"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/suhebk","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2246/photo/ZDhRZFhyR2/d0679a9e-3b38-481d-9200-093104c67d69.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Delhi","position":"Developer","name":"Suhaib Khan","speaking-experience":null,"email":"suheb.work@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/iamsuheb","gender":"Male","country":"India","website":"http://suheb.me/","is-featured":null,"organisation":"Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK)","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2246/small/T0xqRUhQYX/0ada0d15-8626-464e-81cd-4568aba5f557.jpg","github":"https://github.com/suheb","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2246/icon/U2JkU3ZXOU/efda4e1c-69d9-4073-8b21-51c0aba71758.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I'm a recent graduate from NSIT, Delhi with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

In this talk, we will go through the various NLP open source available and share my experience being a contributor to Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) and Moses machine translation suite.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/hqK4KWH5yZY","id":"2918","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":1,"name":"Annexe Hall (Ground Floor)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"165"},"track":{"name":"Open Tech","color":"#ff3737","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","id":"216"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2271/photo/NUJuNHpSbV/28a85e38-2b24-4a32-8890-a78d370de995.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Singapore","position":"Data scientist","name":"Liling Tan","speaking-experience":null,"email":"alvations@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/alvations","gender":"Male","country":"Singapore","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"Rakuten Asia","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2271/small/d2FiKzZzaU/152d7684-8ae7-4679-b502-a748a0c8855b.jpg","github":"https://github.com/alvations","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2271/icon/a0ovV05sVz/b0c669ef-9533-4647-ab47-6a428777232c.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Liling is currently a data scientist as Rakuten Asia.

For many query, this is not the best way to optimize them: you need to rethink and rewrite them completely. To do this, you need to know how optimizer and executor work, and keep that in mind while composing your queries. In this talk, I will present an overview of a few less known and rarely used techniques such as:* using and implementing loose index scan for different scenarios;* using IOS in situation where it isn't applicable directly;* replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ();* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins;* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.Using these techniques and some other ideas, we will learn how to optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query, which is a typical task in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different approaches: direct approach (simplest query), optimized direct approach (more complicated version of it), pl/pgsql with different algorithms, and implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql. I will show how this approach can convert almost any read-only non-dynamic (no EXECUTE statements and no exceptions) pl/pgsql code to a plain sql query.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/Ha38lcjVyhQ","id":"2967","session-type":null,"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":2,"name":"Curie & Hershel (Floor 2)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"170"},"track":{"name":"Database - PGDay","color":"#4ac950","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"272"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2314/photo/YS95SUtiV0/a957b93e-009b-4f86-b200-8e3a7b25aa27.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Australia","position":"Enterprenuer","name":"Maksym Boguk","speaking-experience":null,"email":"mb@pgco.me","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":null,"gender":"Male","country":"Ukraine","website":"http://www.postgresql-consulting.com/","is-featured":null,"organisation":"Postgresql-Consulting","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2314/small/SFRHRjNrbG/02556b0e-3aa5-4ae9-a8d4-54893d783e9e.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2314/icon/UWZzeXhlOV/8bcec9b0-e12b-4424-b139-9b43f494d915.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Over 10 years of experience in database management, system troubleshooting, performance tuning and query optimization.

A decade back, most of the organizations either would have their in-house database servers running on certain hardware and storage configuration. Over the period, when the servers become obsolete, then server/storage migration would itself become separate project and the procurement process for new hardware in any organization is usually time consuming process. In last two years, there has been rise in adoption of Cloud that tries to address this and many other issues. Now you do not have to worry about the underlying hardware and storage, once you know CPU, RAM and storage requirement, you can customize the server and build your own server in cloud. Also, migrating Postgres cluster to cloud is a viable option for safety (no data loss, including if rollback), minimal downtime (switchover and rollback), minimal effort for the team.Considering one of the above reasons for moving to cloud, one of our client’s in FinTech space decided to move their PostgreSQL instance to AWS RDS since RDS offered some of the following benefits like:•        Automated failover of primary in case of failure •        Automated creation of replicas•        Automated updates•        A purely declarative setup, via Cloud formationHere I will talk about how technical aspects of moving PostgreSQL server to AWS RDS.•        How to configure, tune the parameters in config file while moving onto RDS. •        How you can select the storage depending upon growth estimate and IOPS requirement•        How you can configure HA setup in RDS.•        How you can distribute your reporting workload.•        How to monitor Postgres instance and alert configuration</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/-9QTJhER9tk","id":"2962","session-type":null,"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":2,"name":"Curie & Hershel (Floor 2)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"170"},"track":{"name":"Database - PGDay","color":"#4ac950","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"272"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2309/photo/M1BVMHZEST/aa892a6d-79f3-4359-8c4d-f8b6332be970.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Mumbai","position":"Database Consultant","name":"Sushant Mahesh Pawar","speaking-experience":null,"email":"sushant.pawar@ashnik.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":null,"gender":"Male","country":"India","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"Ashnik Technologies India Pvt Ltd","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2309/small/UW9zOVdlUW/c6827b65-0571-44d0-a8b7-a0590d58b857.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2309/icon/WW5lT3hxc3/1bb3664b-2956-4039-9189-a600745070ae.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I am a Database Consultant working with Ashnik having more than 9 years of experience in Database Administration.

We have encouraged many of our customers to migrate a lot of database systems to PostgreSQL so far and this contributed much to cost reduction.Some projects need to conform to security standards, for example PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). It is one of the most prevailing security standard in the world. However it is not easy to build and operate a PostgreSQL-based system conformant to these security standards. I'd like to describe some aspects required for secure database systems in general, such as encryption, key management, identity management and auditing.Then I explain considerable points for building a secure database system using PostgreSQL, and show the remaining challenges for secure database systems using PostgreSQL.Finally, I introduce a forked version of pgaudit that we are maintaining, then explain how to use it. pgaudit is developed by 2ndquadrant and Crunchy Data, especially by David Steel with a great contribution. However, it does not meet our customer's requirements. For example, It cannot output the audit log and server log separately, it cannot audit Superuser fully, etc. So we forked it and added some changes.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/I9VeuxYejpw","id":"2964","session-type":null,"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":2,"name":"Curie & Hershel (Floor 2)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"170"},"track":{"name":"Database - PGDay","color":"#4ac950","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"272"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2311/photo/SVprdzhDeH/a25683f9-acff-4dce-9405-af341ef31904.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Tokyo","position":"Developer","name":"Masanori Oyama","speaking-experience":null,"email":"oyama.masanori.1987@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/ooyamams1987?lang=en","gender":null,"country":"Japan","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"NTT OSS Center","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2311/small/cm1WdUdQdU/cf2f9938-9c73-4a7a-9cce-b0deee2213eb.jpg","github":"https://github.com/ooyamams","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2311/icon/SFhTQ2Z2VX/dfc018f4-7f91-4df5-a1f1-551f884d465b.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I worked on Hadoop around 2015 for my former company, NTT DATA Inc.

During this project, we are developing a proof of concept system showing how semantic based machine translation can, in conjunction with robust computational grammars, be used to interact with students, better understand their language errors, and help students correct their grammar through a series of useful feedback messages and guided language drills.Ultimately, we aim to prove the viability of a new integrated rule-based MT approach to disambiguate students’ intended meaning in computer-assisted language teaching. This is a necessary step to provide accurate coaching on how to correct ungrammatical input, and it will allow us to overcome the current bottleneck in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) – an exponential burst of ambiguity caused by ambiguous lexical items.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/KY6mFcuhGoM","id":"2872","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":1,"name":"Mendel (Ground Floor)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"166"},"track":{"name":"AI & Machine Learning","color":"#4da898","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"266"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2228/photo/aDhOMFBaOX/1485941370.37.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Singapore","position":"Researcher","name":"Luis Morgado da Costa","speaking-experience":null,"email":"luis.passos.morgado@gmail.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":null,"gender":"Male","country":"Singapore","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"NTU","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2228/small/OXBKTnNjeX/15ea0a52-db68-4b0f-a1af-7c77b958161d.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2228/icon/QjlaQUNlcH/0c790e33-e158-454d-9664-a8fd7e79e9a2.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I am a researcher in computational linguistics.

The work has been done in association with a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI,  Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibility increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for better understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source web applications, MIT App Inventor, various mobile Apps have been developed for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids have been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This made to develop Apps more clearly, concisely and perfectly. Different Apps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety of topics such as Early Vocabulary,Vehicle and Voice Sounds, Syllable Length Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Discriminate Consonant, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Leaning by Manner, Learning of Colors, Learning various Poems (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining short Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps have been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of the therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the Apps to know the level of learning. During initial stages, suggestions were given by audiologists, special teachers and counselors. After continuous and rigorous reviews and feedbacks, the apps developed had become satisfactory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The results found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interest to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the special kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning through mobile. Also, now they are very much comfortable to train the kids at their homes by using these Apps. The parents are very excited to get all these learning Apps shared to their mobiles.  It  is a great feeling of satisfaction to see kids interested to learn and the parents with bright smile on their face. This all happened by developing learning Apps of open-source software. Over all it's an awesome experience !!</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/vRVaI2YJL9E","id":"2916","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":3,"name":"Fermi (Floor 3)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"197"},"track":{"name":"Health Tech","color":"#7e9c7e","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"223"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/guruswamyrevana","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2269/photo/dGVTTTB4VW/85cfea2e-48aa-4d38-968f-19a0fbd9f03e.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Hyderabad","position":"Associate Professor","name":"Guruswamy Revana","speaking-experience":null,"email":"guru_revana@yahoo.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/GURUSWAMYREVANA","gender":"Male","country":"India","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engineering for Women","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2269/small/SVhzRElxYS/2e946928-f244-430a-9379-b173c17ceec7.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2269/icon/MHd0WTllOV/af5de8c6-526e-4be1-8347-1beffeb8d885.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">This is Guruswamy Revana working as Associate Professor at BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engineering for women.

Servers coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and available for all servers at any given point in time.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/8pUfB5FueLk","id":"2835","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":2,"name":"Curie & Hershel (Floor 2)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"170"},"track":{"name":"Database - MySQL Day","color":"#4ac950","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"253"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkateshduggirala","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2193/photo/NmxOdnd2T3/603a7288-5fcc-41a2-aea7-88cd8c55c3d2.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Bangalore","position":"Developer","name":"Venkatesh Duggirala","speaking-experience":null,"email":"venkatesh.duggirala@oracle.com","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":null,"gender":null,"country":"India","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"ORACLE","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2193/small/K09ZdEM4a2/e54335f2-895f-442d-9313-aa1ee1b97412.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2193/icon/SWtTUDhUdE/5410cc99-b7f4-4bb5-bda9-f5ebfaf5d7a3.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Currently, I am working with MySQL Database team since 2012 as Senior Principle Member Technical Staff, employed by Oracle, based in Bangalore, India.

Today, we’re taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not doing it alone, but with the help of institutions and professors all around the globe.</p><p>What is WikiToLearn? WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!” </p><p>Why is it an innovation?WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone. </p><p>         Why should I contribute?It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be able to continue to grow. Your contribution, as small as it could be, is and will always be fundamental.Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. However, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone decided to contribute to creating it.</p><p>Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire to see, at last, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because so you can really feel useful and part of something great, with the power change the world.</p><p>Who can contribute? </p><ul><li>I’m a university student, I don't have time for this...Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams, as well as to improve your explanation skills. Moreover, this is often the best way to realise what you did not understand, and in case you make a mistake, someone will correct you.</li><li>But I'm a professor!- WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the teachers.Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</li><li>I’m a coder! - Do you want to help WikiToLearn \"under the hood\"? This is the right page for you to get started! First of all, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can also count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribute immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki, so we always need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you’re interested in contributing to open source software, WikiToLearn can be a great place.</li><li>I’m a translator! - Are you fluent in (at least) two languages? WikiToLearn needs you!Translating on WikiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills, at the same time you will learn about new things, and you will contribute to the growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written from scratch, the translation into several languages is as important as the content itself, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.</li></ul><p>Who \"makes\" WikiToLearn? - The project is promoted and coordinated by a community of people, often experts in their own field, who write, review and organise the content. WikiToLearn is a KDE project sponsored by Wikimedia.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/nUosbPB3-EY","id":"2953","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":1,"floor":2,"name":"Einstein (Floor 2)","longitude":1,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"187"},"track":{"name":"Internet, Society & Politics","color":"#9d75b5","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"221"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srijancse","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2300/photo/RXp2ekhvVH/da0db713-62ee-45cb-b0cb-5028892ffb5e.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Koll","position":"Software Developer","name":"Srijan Agarwal","speaking-experience":null,"email":"srijan@wikitolearn.org","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"http://www.twitter.com/srijancse","gender":"Male","country":"India","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"WikiToLearn","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2300/small/dkdvSHZZVS/97b6cd1f-c3b5-4d04-852d-1512f85022c7.jpg","github":"https://github.com/Srijancse","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2300/icon/ZG9Cek03Tn/253952c9-dd56-48a6-b63d-5d8756e53f32.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with strong mathematical background.

As these cities become increasingly complex systems of people and interconnected infrastructure, extreme weather events and long term environmental changes pose acute challenges for disaster response and humanitarian action.Although rapidly urbanizing environments are often thought to be “data scarce,” by enabling residents to share emergency data openly and in real time, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> makes a wealth of information available that promotes resilience to extreme weather events. By gathering, sorting, and visualizing data, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> transforms the noise of social and digital media into critical information for residents, communities, and government agencies. The platform adopts a  “people as sensors” paradigm, where confirmed reports are collected directly from the users at street level in a manner that removes expensive and time-consuming data processing. This framework creates accurate, real-time data which is immediately made available for users and first responders. The CogniCity OSS was designed, tested, and deployed as an operational platform in Jakarta during a three-year (2013-2016) applied research project. As a “proof of platform,” the free web-based flood map <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> was used by hundreds of thousands of residents during monsoon flooding. It is was also adopted by the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) to monitor flood events, to improve response times, and to share emergency information with residents. CogniCity OSS proved the value of crowdsourced social and digital media for emergency response through the <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> platform, but this use of open data for humanitarian disaster response is only a first step. Additional CogniCity OSS modules are in development at the MIT Urban Risk Lab to address other hazards, including earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, typhoons, and terrorism. CogniCity OSS is also being designed to integrate and coordinate additional data sources, including various instant messaging services. And, as CogniCity OSS is deployed as a disaster risk management system in other Asian megacities, additional platform extensions and innovations will provide additional support for humanitarian response to urban disasters.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/TIAlyMh5qQE","id":"2894","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":null,"floor":1,"name":"Mendel (Ground Floor)","longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"166"},"track":{"name":"AI & Machine Learning","color":"#4da898","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"266"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":null,"photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2248/photo/RFd5bFEzb1/0f7e3c63-4471-4005-acb1-3e81dffedd2a.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Jakarta","position":"Architect","name":"Christina Geros","speaking-experience":null,"email":"christina@petabencana.id","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/clgeros","gender":"Female","country":"Indonesia","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"PetaBencana.id","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2248/small/dWJ3MmRSSS/f7373c36-5e7b-4261-bc58-23e010679f54.jpg","github":"https://github.com/urbanriskmap","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2248/icon/RTRGeGdzcV/a3f4bc20-51c4-47f4-bb63-1b7eed4a4b9b.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Christina Leigh Geros is an architect, landscape architect, and urban designer currently conducting and designing research about the intricate relationships between urbanism, ecology, and politics.

And I started CoderDojo in Japan with my friends in OpenSource Cafe in early 2012. It was a very small start and to be honest I wasn't sure if it will grow and scale; however, the fact is that there are now 70+ communities (dojos) in Japan, 1150+ dojos in the world. This means, in Japan, that EVERY week kids can talk and learn about programming face-to-face with people in opensource communities, regardless of where they live (not everywhere for now, but almost).According to the statistics of CoderDojo, currently in Asia, this big growth only happens in Japan. But I think this kind of opensource community will be a great fit for other countries in Asia. So in this talk, as a co-founder and representative director of CoderDojo Japan, I would like to share the knowledges and experiences on how we evolve, what problems we met, and why I'm so encouraged to share them in Asia.# ReferencesKids are coding it for themselves, Nikkei Asian Reviewhttps://<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=321408997945053&amp;id=204862942932993DojoCon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=321408997945053&amp;id=204862942932993DojoCon</a> Japan - The 1st Conference for CoderDojo communities in Japanhttp://<a href=\"http://dojocon.coderdojo.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dojocon.coderdojo.jp/</a></p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/_A8KxTooayg","id":"2928","session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"123"},"microlocation":{"latitude":1,"floor":2,"name":"Einstein (Floor 2)","longitude":1,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"187"},"track":{"name":"Internet, Society & Politics","color":"#9d75b5","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"221"},"speakers":[{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasulab","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2279/photo/d2FnL0M4Y0/3c798a77-9118-4aa8-9d96-e52e3890790c.png","is-email-overridden":false,"city":"Tokyo","position":"Co-founder","name":"Yohei Yasukawa","speaking-experience":null,"email":"yohei@coderdojo.jp","long-biography":null,"heard-from":"Website","deleted-at":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/yasulab","gender":"Male","country":"Japan","website":null,"is-featured":null,"organisation":"CoderDojo Japan","complex-field-values":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2279/small/SW53dlBGaT/b6449912-e16b-4ebb-bca5-f9d95588ca9b.jpg","github":"https://github.com/yasulab","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2279/icon/TDYvUlZlWW/cfec60fe-fc3d-46e6-bd61-87ab443c4095.jpg","sponsorship-required":null,"short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Co-founder of Japanese RailsTutorial, RailsGuides, and CoderDojo Japan.

Completing and achieving top of his cohort there, he returned to Singapore and started to path his own niche - writing, producing, directing and even editing: over half a dozen short films that won awards and critical acclaim, feature films, web and mobile content and more. His specialisation for storytelling also led him to write - produce and direct half a dozen full-length theatre plays and a musical that’s staged at The Esplanade in Singapore, in collaboration with the late, renowned Iskander Ismail.</span><span style=\"\">During this whole time, Lionel also made significant progress in his career in the television, broadcast industry; executive producing 2 seasons of the highly acclaimed ‘Culture Shock’ for Channel News Asia, which went on to be distributed and sold to markets internationally.

Researching deeply about Virtual Reality during that period, Lionel realised this emerging technology could be the game-changer for media and content, and thus - quit his job, packed his bag and uprooted himself and his family to move to London to pursue a Masters degree in Creative Technology; specialising in Augmented and Virtual Reality. There, he produced London’s first ever 360 Virtual Reality Dance staged at Middlesex University and also Singapore Inside out (London) a VR experience (<a href=\"http://www.sgiolondon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.sgiolondon.com</a>) for the the touring exhibition by Singapore Tourism Board.
