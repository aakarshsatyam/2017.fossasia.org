Today, we’re taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not doing it alone, but with the help of institutions and professors all around the globe.</p><p>What is WikiToLearn? WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!” </p><p>Why is it an innovation?WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone. </p><p>         Why should I contribute?It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be able to continue to grow. Your contribution, as small as it could be, is and will always be fundamental.Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. However, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone decided to contribute to creating it.</p><p>Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire to see, at last, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because so you can really feel useful and part of something great, with the power change the world.</p><p>Who can contribute? </p><ul><li>I’m a university student, I don't have time for this...Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams, as well as to improve your explanation skills. Moreover, this is often the best way to realise what you did not understand, and in case you make a mistake, someone will correct you.</li><li>But I'm a professor!- WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the teachers.Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</li><li>I’m a coder! - Do you want to help WikiToLearn \"under the hood\"? This is the right page for you to get started! First of all, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can also count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribute immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki, so we always need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you’re interested in contributing to open source software, WikiToLearn can be a great place.</li><li>I’m a translator! - Are you fluent in (at least) two languages? WikiToLearn needs you!Translating on WikiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills, at the same time you will learn about new things, and you will contribute to the growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written from scratch, the translation into several languages is as important as the content itself, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.</li></ul><p>Who \"makes\" WikiToLearn? - The project is promoted and coordinated by a community of people, often experts in their own field, who write, review and organise the content. WikiToLearn is a KDE project sponsored by Wikimedia.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/nUosbPB3-EY","id":"2953"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T11:13:12.562821+00:00","title":"The common bot - species, development and breeding","audio-url":null,"state":"accepted","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-30T21:27:52.562000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-18T13:46:24.461026+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T11:30:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T11:55:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Bots have been living inside computer systems for quite a while, and they recently entered the public consciousness.

It was a very small start and to be honest I wasn't sure if it will grow and scale; however, the fact is that there are now 70+ communities (dojos) in Japan, 1150+ dojos in the world. This means, in Japan, that EVERY week kids can talk and learn about programming face-to-face with people in opensource communities, regardless of where they live (not everywhere for now, but almost).According to the statistics of CoderDojo, currently in Asia, this big growth only happens in Japan. But I think this kind of opensource community will be a great fit for other countries in Asia. So in this talk, as a co-founder and representative director of CoderDojo Japan, I would like to share the knowledges and experiences on how we evolve, what problems we met, and why I'm so encouraged to share them in Asia.# ReferencesKids are coding it for themselves, Nikkei Asian Reviewhttps://<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=321408997945053&amp;id=204862942932993DojoCon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=321408997945053&amp;id=204862942932993DojoCon</a> Japan - The 1st Conference for CoderDojo communities in Japanhttp://<a href=\"http://dojocon.coderdojo.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dojocon.coderdojo.jp/</a></p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/_A8KxTooayg","id":"2928"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T11:01:50.676518+00:00","title":"The trends in choosing licenses in Python ecosystem","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-31T17:51:02.944000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-18T13:46:59.170794+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T12:30:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T12:55:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>The software licenses are the permissions over copyrighted software.

To do this, you need to know how optimizer and executor work, and keep that in mind while composing your queries. In this talk, I will present an overview of a few less known and rarely used techniques such as:* using and implementing loose index scan for different scenarios;* using IOS in situation where it isn't applicable directly;* replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ();* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins;* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.Using these techniques and some other ideas, we will learn how to optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query, which is a typical task in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different approaches: direct approach (simplest query), optimized direct approach (more complicated version of it), pl/pgsql with different algorithms, and implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql.

A decade back, most of the organizations either would have their in-house database servers running on certain hardware and storage configuration.

We have encouraged many of our customers to migrate a lot of database systems to PostgreSQL so far and this contributed much to cost reduction.Some projects need to conform to security standards, for example PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). It is one of the most prevailing security standard in the world. However it is not easy to build and operate a PostgreSQL-based system conformant to these security standards. I'd like to describe some aspects required for secure database systems in general, such as encryption, key management, identity management and auditing.Then I explain considerable points for building a secure database system using PostgreSQL, and show the remaining challenges for secure database systems using PostgreSQL.Finally, I introduce a forked version of pgaudit that we are maintaining, then explain how to use it. pgaudit is developed by 2ndquadrant and Crunchy Data, especially by David Steel with a great contribution. However, it does not meet our customer's requirements. For example, It cannot output the audit log and server log separately, it cannot audit Superuser fully, etc. So we forked it and added some changes.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/I9VeuxYejpw","id":"2964"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/45da88b7/tracks?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"name":"Database","color":"#4ac950","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"271","sessions":[{"created-at":"2017-02-13T12:05:02.892387+00:00","title":"Two opensource RDBMS: mariadb vs postgresql","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-16T19:41:35.120000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-04-26T10:08:09.466015+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T12:45:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T13:05:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Instead of saying which RDBMS is better and then starts the flame war, this talk will focus on the internal difference between two popular RDBMS.This talk will show you the common practices on these RDBMS, and how the internal differences affecting our usage on these RDBMS.(level of this talk: introductory)</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/9b-Uk-pksLc","id":"2931"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/45da88b7/tracks?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"name":"Python","color":"#f2da04","deleted-at":null,"description":null,"font-color":"#000000","id":"265","sessions":[{"created-at":"2017-01-30T10:56:00.317385+00:00","title":"MicroPython workshop using NodeMCU - workshop 2hrs","audio-url":null,"state":"accepted","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-31T17:49:43.807036+00:00","last-modified-at":"2017-01-31T17:49:43.807036+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-18T15:30:00+00:00","comments":null,"level":null,"long-abstract":"<p></p>","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-18T17:25:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>In this workshop we will learn about MicroPython.

It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).

It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package. </span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>","video-url":null,"id":"2891"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T11:33:25.824522+00:00","title":"Connecting design, culture, art, and technology across the archipelago","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-31T17:47:21.632000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-18T13:21:40.328211+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T16:15:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T16:40:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Art, design, and cultural events and organisations have proliferated in Indonesia in various scales.

Are there differences in participants' expectations?- Should the designer be involved in the project from the beginning to the end? - Should the designer be also a technical person? - Should the designer be responsible for the implementation of his proposals? - What we request in a design work is realistic and according to designer's specialty? - How can we evaluate a designer's proposals inside our community? - Can we have more than one designer involved in the community? - Do we know our target and provide full specifications when requesting design work? - Who should have the final decision on design proposals? - Is the designer responsible for all the usability problems of the project?- Why it is so easy to provide design feedback?- etc.All the above are valid questions when interacting with designers in open source communities and some times the answers don't match.

The work has been done in association with a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI,  Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibility increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for better understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source web applications, MIT App Inventor, various mobile Apps have been developed for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids have been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This made to develop Apps more clearly, concisely and perfectly. Different Apps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety of topics such as Early Vocabulary,Vehicle and Voice Sounds, Syllable Length Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Discriminate Consonant, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Leaning by Manner, Learning of Colors, Learning various Poems (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining short Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps have been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of the therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the Apps to know the level of learning. During initial stages, suggestions were given by audiologists, special teachers and counselors. After continuous and rigorous reviews and feedbacks, the apps developed had become satisfactory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The results found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interest to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the special kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning through mobile.

I will be talking about how we worked with the government and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development, scalability, security, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dynamic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different government and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included automated source code testing, white boxtesting, blackbox testing and manual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app, we did multiple load tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers.

The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface from C++, Python, Octave, R, Java, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc. This not just means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++ and target languages. One of the focus point of the talk is the introduction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a user can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' syntax, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported languages of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the number of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the method being exposed to all of the target languages, but it allows us to have those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics, the toolbox saw massive extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many classical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric, multi-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature hashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few. Shogun in addition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel hypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc. All algorithms are supported by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning, preprocessing, serialisation &amp; I/O, etc; the resulting combinatorial possibilities are huge.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/gD_l_VnNL7U","id":"2843"},{"created-at":"2020-04-22T13:58:23.234748+00:00","title":"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Personal Assistants","audio-url":null,"state":"accepted","subtitle":"","signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2020-04-22T13:58:22.801000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-04-22T13:59:00.248266+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":null,"comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":null,"average-rating":null,"ends-at":null,"slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Personal Assistants","video-url":null,"id":"6226"},{"created-at":"2020-04-23T05:39:36.526214+00:00","title":"PostGIS in Agribotics","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":"","signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2020-04-23T05:39:35.593000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-11T12:51:57.532846+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":null,"comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"","average-rating":null,"ends-at":null,"slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"As a major agricultural producer and exporter; with farming associated services contributing up to 12% of GDP, Australia invests heavily in research and development for this sector.Agribotics is one of the new areas where Australian crop producers are looking to increase efficiency when it comes to seeds, watering, fertilizing and harvesting crops.We look at how PostGIS (The PostgreSQL GIS extension)can be used in the processing of Near-Infrared images and NDVI maps in this interesting new area of agriculture.","video-url":"https://youtu.be/45xIQoA-VwE","id":"6227"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T10:12:25.912204+00:00","title":"Getting started with open source game playing AIs","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-30T23:56:41.494000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-11T13:10:56.106813+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-18T15:30:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-18T15:55:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Open source game playing AIs have come a long way since the first closedsourced programs defeated the best human players.

As a concluding remark, I will discuss the potential of open-sourcing medical imaging data and the benefits it will bring to the medical field as a whole, telling my story of how I originally got involved with an open source project called <a href=\"http://CancerBase.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CancerBase.org</a> and how that developed into an opportunity to work at a professional lab.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/eTjrNS7xt-Y","id":"2895"},{"created-at":"2017-02-19T19:11:46.747052+00:00","title":"Machine Learning for source code analysis","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-20T09:33:53.642000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-11T13:00:43.898926+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-18T13:00:00+00:00","comments":"","level":"Beginner","long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-18T13:25:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>What if all open source software can be treated as a dataset?

As these cities become increasingly complex systems of people and interconnected infrastructure, extreme weather events and long term environmental changes pose acute challenges for disaster response and humanitarian action.Although rapidly urbanizing environments are often thought to be “data scarce,” by enabling residents to share emergency data openly and in real time, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> makes a wealth of information available that promotes resilience to extreme weather events. By gathering, sorting, and visualizing data, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> transforms the noise of social and digital media into critical information for residents, communities, and government agencies. The platform adopts a  “people as sensors” paradigm, where confirmed reports are collected directly from the users at street level in a manner that removes expensive and time-consuming data processing. This framework creates accurate, real-time data which is immediately made available for users and first responders. The CogniCity OSS was designed, tested, and deployed as an operational platform in Jakarta during a three-year (2013-2016) applied research project. As a “proof of platform,” the free web-based flood map <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> was used by hundreds of thousands of residents during monsoon flooding. It is was also adopted by the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) to monitor flood events, to improve response times, and to share emergency information with residents. CogniCity OSS proved the value of crowdsourced social and digital media for emergency response through the <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> platform, but this use of open data for humanitarian disaster response is only a first step. Additional CogniCity OSS modules are in development at the MIT Urban Risk Lab to address other hazards, including earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, typhoons, and terrorism. CogniCity OSS is also being designed to integrate and coordinate additional data sources, including various instant messaging services. And, as CogniCity OSS is deployed as a disaster risk management system in other Asian megacities, additional platform extensions and innovations will provide additional support for humanitarian response to urban disasters.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/TIAlyMh5qQE","id":"2894"},{"created-at":"2017-02-07T16:02:20.970331+00:00","title":"Artificial Intelligence: The Recent Past","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-16T15:28:28.690000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-04-26T10:04:02.701537+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T12:25:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T12:45:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>The motive is not to criticize Artificial Intelligence as the past, as the name of the talk suggest.

Servers coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and available for all servers at any given point in time.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/8pUfB5FueLk","id":"2835"},{"created-at":"2017-02-13T16:54:29.905474+00:00","title":"Unleash the power of Generated/Virtual Columns in MySQL","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-16T19:43:02.911000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-18T13:23:58.514017+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T14:35:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T14:55:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Get in depth knowledge of implementation and usage of Generated/Virtual Columns in MySQL(a new feature in MySQL 5.7). * Generated Columns can be used as materialized storage for most used expressions.* It provides a way for supporting indexes for joins with non-relational data(JSON data type) and it gives an option to either store the value of expression or let it be calculated on the fly when the record is read from the table. * Last but not the least we support indexing on these column.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/YQtRO_O3GWM","id":"2933"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T15:03:40.669911+00:00","title":"MySQL Replication: Latest Developments","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-01T09:05:58.607000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-05-18T13:25:55.726073+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T16:20:00+00:00","comments":"","level":null,"long-abstract":"","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T16:40:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>The MySQL Replication Team at ORACLE has been striving to provide community with great replication features.

This gives rise to the need for heterogeneous computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style=\"\">These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar co-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span style=\"\">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily available off the shelf, some of them as commercially available system on chips (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software programmer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware accelerators within a system on chip are many, such as high-performance gains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the exotic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it. </span><span style=\"\">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write accelerators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abstraction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively difficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a few years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the name suggests. However off late, with computing problems of large sizes and datasets, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style=\"\">Even with a great number of devices available, the difference in programming models makes it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=\"\">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware acceleration, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use these devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration. In order to achieve the full potential of hardware acceleration, multiple heterogeneous devices within the same SoC must be programmable using a single programming model and also the programming model must be portable across devices without loss of functionality. The aim of this talk is to throw light on the OpenCL(Open Computing Language API) and its potential for being the one single language that can be used to program multiple devices.</span></p>","video-url":null,"id":"2958"},{"created-at":"2017-01-31T01:55:40.121551+00:00","title":"Automatic Mushroom Farming with Open Tech","audio-url":null,"state":"confirmed","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-02-02T09:23:11.256000+00:00","last-modified-at":"2020-04-26T09:11:27.923206+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-18T14:05:00+00:00","comments":"","level":"Intermediate","long-abstract":"<ul><li>What our software does and how it looks like.</li><li>The FOSS software stack we uses to build the planting room control system: Python, Django, PostgreSQL etc</li><li>Some challenge we faced (network issue, database issue) in our special condition, and how we overcame it.</li></ul>","language":null,"average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-18T14:30:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>How we use free and open source software to build our automatic mushroom planting house.</p>","video-url":"https://youtu.be/88UvIcmZpz4","id":"2846"},{"created-at":"2017-01-30T10:50:46.017929+00:00","title":"Basics of Arm Neon assembly on an Computer Vision example - workshop 2hrs","audio-url":null,"state":"accepted","subtitle":null,"signup-url":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-locked":false,"submitted-at":"2017-01-31T17:50:48.372657+00:00","last-modified-at":"2017-01-31T17:50:48.372657+00:00","is-mail-sent":false,"complex-field-values":null,"starts-at":"2017-03-19T12:45:00+00:00","comments":null,"level":null,"long-abstract":"<p></p>","language":"English","average-rating":null,"ends-at":"2017-03-19T14:40:00+00:00","slides-url":null,"short-abstract":"<p>In the first part of the workshop I will give a basic introduction on how a Camera can estimate a traveled path and localize itself in an unknown enviroment (Visual Odometry).

It’ll also showcase running background tasks and time based tasks like triggers using Azure webjobs and webservices. This talk will be beneficial to startups and enterprises which aim to build robust and reliable engineering systems and will be using the Azure Application Insights service to showcase how the tool can help with quick fault detections and out of the box features for user demographics and behaviour. Having such telemetry and notification features in place will help find faults as they happen. The talk will be a showcase on how Microsoft does IT for maintaining and running applications with high availability and low errors.The entire talk and demos would be done using open source tools like Python tools for Visual Studio (PTVS), Node tools for Visual Studio (NTVS) while showcasing capabilities like using multiple virtual environments, built in debuggers a powerful IDE.
